# C-VideoStore
A tutorial project building a Video Rental store using ASP.NET 5.0

This was my learning project for ASP.NET MVC 5.0
It is a VERY basic Video rental app designed for a Blockbuster style buisiness.
It makes use of Entity Frameworks code-first migrations to build models of customers and movies and allows the creation of new records joining the two.

As this was a learning exercise the code in here is not of a commercial standard and still contains relics of older methodologies, for example matching indidual object properties, that was later replaced by use of Automapper. 
Likewise very little in the way of Aesthetic optimisation has been done, as the function was to learn the framework, over producing a polished product.

The main goals of this project were to learn:
1.the file structure of MVC style apps.
2.the code-first method of using Entity framework.
3.the various helper methods of the Razor view engine.
4.how to make views that interact with the server or API's
5.how to make API's that can be accessed via a different front-end.
